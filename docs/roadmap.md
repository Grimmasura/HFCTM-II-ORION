# ORION âˆž Feature Activation Roadmap

## 1. Recursive AI Core
- Implement dataset ingestion for local and remote sources.
- Support PPO and A3C algorithms via stable-baselines3.
- Add recursive inference with identity-memory tracking.
- Provide checkpointing and restoration utilities.
- Extend `/infer` with streaming responses, depth tracking, and recursion parameters.

## 2. Quantum Synchronization Engine
- Accept quantum jobs through `/quantum/submit`.
- Track entangled state IDs and execution status.
- Support hybrid queues for simulators and IBMQ backends.
- Feed quantum states back into recursive agents.

## 3. Egregore Defense System
- Fingerprint requests and score malicious patterns.
- Maintain a threat registry with quarantine protocols.
- Expose `/defense/report` for external intel.
- Route high-risk traffic to sandbox agents or honey pots.

## 4. Manifold Router
- Dispatch tasks via DAG-based job queues using Celery or Dramatiq.
- Stream task status over WebSocket connections.
- Route tasks based on semantic tags, complexity, and urgency.

## 5. Live Monitoring Dashboard
- Collect metrics with Prometheus.
- Visualize subsystem health in Grafana dashboards.
- Configure alerts for anomalies or halts.

## 6. Documentation & Developer Portal
- Auto-generate API reference from OpenAPI schemas.
- Provide architecture diagrams for recursion and defense flows.
- Include CLI and Python client examples.
- Document a sample recursive AI experiment.
