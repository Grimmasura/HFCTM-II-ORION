# Validation Report Template

Summarise the outcome of validation experiments S1–S6. Populate the table
below with the key metrics and qualitative notes from each run.

| Experiment | Dataset | Pass/Fail | Δλ | Recovery Time | AUC | EER | v̂_r | FP/TPR Drift | QoS Δ | Overhead | Notes | Next Steps |
|-----------|---------|-----------|---|---------------|-----|-----|-----|---------------|--------|----------|-------|-----------|
| S1 – E8 anchor ablation | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| S2 – Chiral inversion efficacy | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| S3 – Cross-architecture calibration | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| S4 – Evasion robustness | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| S5 – Overhead profiling | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| S6 – Integration safety | | | | | | | | | | | | |

**Notes:**
- *Pass/Fail* should reflect thresholds agreed upon by the evaluation team.
- *Next Steps* may include follow-up experiments, mitigation plans, or
  deployment recommendations.
